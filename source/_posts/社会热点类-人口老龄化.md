As can be seen from the mixed chart above, the population over 60 years old in China has increased markedly from 2000 and will continue to grow in the coming decades. 
From the statistics given in the diagram, we can estimate that there were 120 million aged people in 2000, accounting for about 10% of the total population, while the number will shoot up to 450 million in 2050, approximately 35% of the total.
