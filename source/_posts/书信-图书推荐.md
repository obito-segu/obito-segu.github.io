Dear Friends,

	As the host of the upcoming reading session, I am writing this email to recommend to you my favourite book, Tao Te Ching, which was written by Lao Tzu.


	The primary causes of my recommendation are as follows. To begin with, it is the best-loved of all the classical books of China and the most universally popular. In addition, the book encapsulates the main tenets of Taoism, and upholds a way of being as well as a philosophy and a religion. The dominant image in the book is of the Way, the mysterious path through the whole cosmos modeled on the Milky Way that traverses the heavens.


	I hope the above information will help you to understand the book. If you need any further information about this selection, please do not hesitate to contact me.

							Yours sincerely,
							Li Ming
