# Translation

1. Once again,the space agency has been forced to put off the flight until it can find a solution to the problem, and no one seems willing to guess how that may take.

{初}：再一次，




2. Space officials were justifiably happy that so much had gone well, despite daily worries over possible risks. The flight clearly achieved its prime objectives.




3. They replaced a broken device, repaired another and carted away a load of rubbish that had been left on the station, showing the shuttle can bring full loads back down from space.






4. New sensing and photographic equipment to look for potentially dangerous damage to the sensitive external skin proved valuable.







5. The flood of images and the openness in discussing its uncertainties about potential hazards sometimes made it appear that the shuttle was about to fall apart. In the end the damage was clearly tolerable.
