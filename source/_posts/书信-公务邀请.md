Dear Professor Smith,

	On behalf of the "Talents" English Speech Contests committee, I'm writing to invite you to be our new judge.
	As the core of our "Foreign Culture Festival", this school-wide contest is to be held in the Students' Auditorium on May 12(next Sunday).
	And we believe that you can give our competitors some enlightening comments as both a native-English speaker and a knowledgeable  professor.
	Specifically, the event will start at around 7:00 p.m., and last for 2 hours at most.
	At the end of it, we will have some hand-made presents for each judge and competitor.

	Once again, we sincerely hope you can be the judge for our competition.
	Please RSVP before this weekend.


					Your sincerely,
					Li Ming
					Chairman of the "Talents" Speech Contest committee
