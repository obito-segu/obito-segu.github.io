Dear Professor Cook,

	We are greatly honored to welcome you as a guest professor at our university. I would like to recommend two scenic spots in our city: the Palace Museum and the Great Wall.

	The primary reasons are as follows. To begin with, the Palace Museum, also known as the Fobidden City, was the imperial palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It is also the largest piece of ancient Chinese architecture currently existing. 
	Meanwhile,the Great Wall ,symbolizing China's ancient civilization, is one of the world's most renowned projects. As the great creation of the ancient Chinese people and one of the wonders of the world, it was listed as one of the world heritage sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1987.

	I hope you will have the opportunity to visit one or both of these spots. We wish you enjoy your stay in our city.


													Sinerely yours,
													Li Ming
